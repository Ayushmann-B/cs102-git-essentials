5 git commands that i learned so far :
git-keygen -t RSA
git add
git clone
git commit
git push/pull
In today's lecture i learned about creating ssh keys and adding it to Github repository.
I learned how to clone a repository to local machine using wsl and also learned how to stage and commit the changes in local repository and then to push the changes to github.
At the end i also learned how to pull the changes feom github to local machine using git pull command.
